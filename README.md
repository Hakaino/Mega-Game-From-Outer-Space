# Mega-Game-From-Outer-Space
Probably the project that I invested more time in Python, I have learned a lot doing this.

I am working on a android game at the moment, and seeing this reminds me of the long path that i took to be where I am now, this was the 69th version of it and I didn't knew anything about developing games at that time.
Anyway I'm still jobless, I'm still poor and I still love to develop. ^_^
